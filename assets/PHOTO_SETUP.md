## Photos Needed for Your Website

To personalize your Valentine's Day website, please add the following photos to the `assets/photos/` folder:

### Required Photos:
1. **photo1.jpg** - A photo from your first date or early in your relationship
2. **photo2.jpg** - A romantic sunset or scenic photo together
3. **photo3.jpg** - A fun photo of you two cooking or doing activities together

### Photo Requirements:
- **Format**: JPG or PNG
- **Size**: Recommended 800x600 pixels or larger
- **Aspect Ratio**: Try to keep photos in landscape orientation (wider than tall)
- **Quality**: High resolution for best appearance

### How to Add Photos:
1. Save your chosen photos with the exact names listed above
2. Copy them to the `assets/photos/` folder
3. The website will automatically display them in the memories section

### Placeholder Images:
If you don't have photos ready, the website will show placeholder areas where the photos should be. You can add them later.

### Tips for Best Results:
- Choose photos that represent special moments in your relationship
- Ensure photos are well-lit and clear
- Consider the emotional story each photo tells
- Mix different types of moments (romantic, fun, adventurous, intimate)

## Customization Options:
- You can update the photo captions in the HTML file (`index.html`)
- Look for the `photo-overlay` sections to change the titles and descriptions
- Add more photos by duplicating the `photo-item` HTML structure
